## Summary

"t00mietum comfort" is a bottom-up ergonomic redesign keyboard layout for QMK programmable keyboards. There were no sacred cows - not modifiers, not symbols ... only statistically validaded and human-tested comfort.

## Basic layout descriptions

These layouts are designed to be fully functional even on minimalist split keyboards with only 30 main keys and three thumb keys per side. (Like the ["Microdox"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t00mietum/keyboard/main/images/microdox.jpg) from [boardsource.xyz](https://boardsource.xyz/store/5f2e7e4a2902de7151494f92).)

### t00mietum Comfort

This layout is optimized to minimize use of pinkies, index finger stretching, and the most uncomfortable curls; and maximize speed and accuracy. (Recognizing that optimizing all possible parameters simultaneously isn't possible.)

*Note: Users who have no RSI or strength issues with their ring fingers, may wish to swap the "U" and "I" keys, as that will allow for slightly higher inward-rolling word frequency.*

### t00mietum QWERTY

This layout is optimized to minimize use of pinkies, while the alpha keys are still QWERTY.

### Gaming

This layer minimizes multifunction keys, which is necessary for gaming.
